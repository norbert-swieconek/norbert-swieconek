I'm a frontend developer who is passionate about making modern websites and applications. I'm at the beginning of the path but I uncovered that is my passion. Learning comes easy to me, and I get a lot of satisfaction out of programming. I'm the one who values clean code the most.

Currently I'm learning React and I hone JavaScript.&nbsp; :book:
